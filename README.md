# Who is this for?

Primarily, this is for me! But I think it will be useful for any Omeka developer who is looking to start a theme from scratch but would appreciate a little headstart. To use this theme, you need to be adept at CSS and at least somewhat acquainted with JavaScript.

# How does it work?

You just design on top of it. Note that the `default.css` contains some styles that are important to functionality. Where possible, I'll add notes (todo). Or you can just overwrite existing styles in the `custom.css` file. Don't forget to change the info in `theme.ini`.
